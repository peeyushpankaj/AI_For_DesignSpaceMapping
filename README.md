# AI Workshop for Design Space Mapping & Optimization in a Multi-Objective System 

## Agenda
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming engineering systems across industries—from smarter designs and efficient diagnostics to intelligent automation and predictive maintenance. MATLAB offers a unified AI platform tailored for engineers and scientists, enabling rapid development and deployment of AI models with minimal coding.
This session will explore the complete AI workflow in MATLAB, from data access and preprocessing to model building, tuning, and deployment. A special focus will be given to Reduced Order Modeling (ROM)—a powerful technique for simplifying complex physical systems while preserving essential behavior, enabling faster simulations and real-time control. The session will also cover Design Optimization, demonstrating how AI-driven optimization algorithms in MATLAB can be used to automatically improve system performance, reduce costs, and accelerate product development cycles.

This interactive hands-on session will include the following: 
* Familiarizing yourself with MATLAB Online and AI tools in MATLAB ecosystem with an introductory example of a Turboshaft Engine 
* Generating synthetic data from a physics-based Digital Twin with parallel simulation
* Data pre-processing to extract simulation results and focus only on steady-state simulation results
* Exploring how to train a series of Regression models with interative applications in MATLAB
* Utilizing Reduced Order Models for each System Objective to derive the Design space
* Multi-objective Optimization with AI ROMs

MathWorks instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) will be available throughout the session to guide you. If the event is being held onsite, please bring your laptop and install the Google Chrome browser beforehand.
